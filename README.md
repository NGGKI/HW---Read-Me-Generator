inquirer will prompt you for your inputs from the command line.
axios will fetch your info from the GitHub API.
The application will start by running node index.js in the command line.

Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'ExampleREADME.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.

The README has some automatically generated badges for your repo courtesy of shields.io and will include your profile picture & email from GitHub.

## Usage

When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.
